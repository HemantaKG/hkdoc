==== How to Find and Kill All Zombie Processes ====
[[https://www.servernoobs.com/how-to-find-and-kill-all-zombie-processes/|Ref:]]
On Unix operating systems, a **zombie process or defunct process** is a process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table, allowing the process that started it to read its exit status. It almost always means that the parent is still around. If the parent exited, the child would be orphaned and re-parented to init, which would immediately perform the wait(). In other words, they should go away once the parent process is done.

A zombie process doesnâ€™t react to signals.
== Find out Zombie process ==
<code>ps aux |grep "defunct"</code>
OR
<code>ps aux |grep Z</code>
== List the PID of Zombie ==
<code>ps aux | awk '{ print $8 " " $2 }' | grep -w Z</code>
In order to kill these processes, you need to find the parent process first
<code>pstree -paul
kill -9 <<parent process ID>></code>
==== Kill all processes which matching the string pattern ====
kill al process running by **hemanta**
string pattern: **hemanta**
<code>
ps -ef | grep 'hemanta' | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -r kill -9
</code>
